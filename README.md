# Android-SinglePlayerChecker
## A personal Android project.

This is a checker-like game for a single player. The player can drag & drop to move a piece to a new
spot when:
* the dropping spot is empty -- no piece exists there
* there is one and only one piece sits between the selected piece and the drop spot

After a success move, the piece which got across-over is removed.

The game is end when there is no more valid move exist.

When the game ends, the result could be...
* Only 1 piece remains -- You are a GENIUS!
* 2 - 3 pieces remain -- Not bad, dude
* 4 pieces remain -- About average...
* 5 or more -- Err... how did you do this?!?!
